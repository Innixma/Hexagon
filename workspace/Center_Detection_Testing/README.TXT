Run testRotProblem.m to see an example.  It takes the (manually found) center of rotationProblem.png, crops around that center,
and passes the cropped image to real_centerbox_final.m which finds the distances and angles to the vertices of the shape around
 the center of the image.  That is, the coordinates are presented in (r, theta) form.
