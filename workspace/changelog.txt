V0.02 By Nick Erickson
- The AI now plays the game.
	- Basic pathfinding, avoids walls but can't follow patterns (has no memory of past states)
		- Does not track wall velocity or how close the wall is from the player.
		- Moves and stops moving each update, so can't move precisely.
- Improved player detection to find center of triangle
- 144.5 seconds survived on "Base" level.
