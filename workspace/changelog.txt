V0.12 By Nick Erickson
- Made centerbox detection scale invariant
- Will make player detection truly scale invariant soon

V0.11 By Nick Erickson
- HUGE PROGRESS
- Fixed Velocity of walls
- AI can now play levels of ANY rotation speed
- AI can now play very fast levels
- AI only fails due to low framerate

V0.10 By Nick Erickson
- Made player detection dynamic (Resistant to pulse)
- Fixed player detection (I think?)
- Still need to fix velocity of walls, currently fixed.
- Still need to fix centerbox detection to not be hardcoded.
- Fixed player position prediction
- Removed redundant variables

V0.09 By Nick Erickson
- HUGE UPDATE
- Fixed pathfinding for rotation (AI can play rotation levels now!)
- Expanded video playback feature immensely
- Added player position prediction based off of previous move (MUCH better now, this fixes pinging)
- Issues with player detection and close walls, will look into. (Appears to be only major issue remaining)
- Still need to fix velocity of walls, currently fixed.
- Still need to fix centerbox detection to not be hardcoded.
- Still need to fix player detection to work on dynamic resolution.

V0.08 By Nick Erickson
- Added in video playback feature
- Still not fully fleshed out
- Will fix pathfinding next

V0.07 By Nick Erickson
- Rotation Invariant Center Detection working.
- Still issues with Player Detection
- Will Implement video playback soon

V0.06 By Nick Erickson
- New Player Detection Fixed, works well
- Still a few issues at extreme cases, will fix.
- 950 seconds survived on "Base" level. (Impossible for a human)

V0.05 By Nick Erickson
- New Player Detection Implemented, fully reworked.
- Old Player Detection fully removed.
- Some issues with New Player Detection, will fix.
- 310 seconds survived on "Base" level.

V0.04 By Nick Erickson
- Dynamic Resolution
- Binary Image thresholding
- Screenselect by Josh Glendenning
- New Player Detection (detect_player_nick) by Danesh and edited by Nick
- New Player Detection not implemented yet.

V0.03 By Nick Erickson
- Far improved screencapture algorithm, much faster processing times.
- Transitioning to working in arbitrary resolution.
- 217.8 seconds survived on "Base" level.

V0.02 By Nick Erickson
- The AI now plays the game.
	- Basic pathfinding, avoids walls but can't follow patterns (has no memory of past states)
		- Does not track wall velocity or how close the wall is from the player.
		- Moves and stops moving each update, so can't move precisely.
- Improved player detection to find center of triangle
- 144.5 seconds survived on "Base" level.


V0.01 By Nick Erickson
- Code doesn't play yet.
- Will make code act on information in V0.02
- Detects player and walls, but hardcoded to level and resolution.
- 1920x1080 Resolution Maximized Windowed
- "Base" custom level only
