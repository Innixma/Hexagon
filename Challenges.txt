1. Get screen output in real time

2. Process screen output in real time as game is playing (Parallel computation potentially)
    a. Cancel Rotation
    b. Cancel Pulse
    c. Cancel Color
    d. Cancel Distortion/3D
    e. Create Safest Path (Series of inputs over time)

3. Detect Player
    a. Detect player velocity/direction (Allows to predict into the future where you will be given a series of inputs)

4. Detect Hostile Lines
    a. Detect Hostile Line Velocity/Acceleration
    b. Object Recognition/Tracking over multiple frames for varying velocity lines.

5. Act on processed information in real time (overriding inputs)

6. Method for AI learning (Machine Learning potentially)

7. Create custom levels for basic challenges (Really easy levels)
